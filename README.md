Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 6: Make Effective Data Visualization

# Summary

This visualization shows survivals distribution between 3 different passenger classes. It is built based on the Titanic dataset which contains demographics and passenger information from a subset of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic.

Plot show that the better the class the higher is the percentage of survivals in that class.  First class passengers had 67% survival rate while 3rd class passengers only had 22% survival rate.


# Design


In my design, I decided to use vertical 100% bar plot to show correlation between survival and passenger class.
Bars on the plot are colored green/red which corresponds to survival/not survival of a passenger. x axis corresponds to the class of the passenger (1, 2, 3) and y axis corresponds to the percentage of survived/not survived passengers.



# Feedback


Most mentioned points I have gathered from several people

* From the graph it is clearly seen that there is a relationship between survival and passenger class.

* Percent of people died in each class increases from 1st to 2nd to 3rd classes.
Percent of people survived in each class decreases from 1st to 2nd to 3rd class.

* One thing that is not clear straight away is what 0 or 1 on the legend mean. Even though it gets clear after the inspection of the graph the legend needs to be changed to something more concrete.

* Legend and axes titles are too small

* Tooltip is confusing. What does PassangerID percent mean?

In my final version, I have fixed these formatting issues.
